      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">1. SSL Encryption</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
        SSL encryption secures your internet connection and protects personal and financial data during transactions. Websites with SSL encryption start with <strong>‚Äúhttps‚Äù</strong> instead of ‚Äúhttp,‚Äù indicating a secure environment for shopping.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
        We&#39;ve recently updated our website&#39;s SSL security to further protect your information and keep it safe from potential risks.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">2. Credit Card Information</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
        We <strong>do not store any credit card information</strong> on our website. All payments are processed through the secure <strong>PayPal payment gateway</strong>, ensuring your payment details remain protected.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
        For enhanced security, we recommend setting a strong password that includes:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mt-2">
        <li>Uppercase and lowercase letters</li>
        <li>Numbers</li>
        <li>Special characters</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
        Avoid using the same password across different websites. A unique password helps protect your account against unauthorized access.
